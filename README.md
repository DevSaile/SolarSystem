## Description

    The Solar System Simulation is a 3D visualization project that simulates the solar system with planets. The simulation uses OpenGL for rendering, Python for logic, and several libraries to handle textures, sound, object loading, and camera control. Users can navigate through space using keyboard controls and view the scene from different angles using mouse movements.

## How Itâ€™s Built

- The simulation is created using:

    - OpenGL: For rendering 3D models and textures.
    - Python: Handling logic and integrating various libraries.
    - GLFW: Creating windows, contexts, and managing input.
    - Pyrr: Performing matrix and vector operations.
    - PIL: Loading images and textures.
    - Pygame: Playing sound.
